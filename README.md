# Hi there, it's me, Iga 👋

My name is Iga Miękus and since 2018 I have been gaining experience in the IT field in the role of a software quality specialist or, if you prefer, a software tester. I have been involved in the projects for both multinational corporations and local companies. **What marks me out is my particular love for documentation**, which I believe is the foundation of effective project management and ensures transparency at every stage of the project. **I strive to ensure that my actions not only eliminate errors, but also support the long-term success of the projects I work on**.
